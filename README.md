Hello! I’m TheAxolotlLord.

I’m interested in coding, gaming, and chillin'.

I’m currently learning some more Python, and I want to get into C or C++

My pronouns are He/Him/His, but I could care less what pronouns you use.

Fun fact: I'm bored!

I also have a [YT](https://youtube.com/@realaxolotllord), which you should subscribe to.
