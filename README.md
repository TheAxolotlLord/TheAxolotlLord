Hello! I’m TheAxolotlLord.

I’m interested in coding, gaming, and chillin'.

My pronouns are He/Him/His, but I could care less what pronouns you use.

Check out my [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/TheAxolotlLord) Page!
I also have a [YT](https://youtube.com/@realaxolotllord), which you should subscribe to.

This list will probably change in the future. HTML, CSS, maybe JS, C, C++, Ren'Py, and potentially many more probably will appear here!

also, i'm sorry that i stole part of your readme.md file, [velliax](https://github.com/Veillax). it's fine tho, right?
